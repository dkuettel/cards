! botlzmann-machine.md is misnamed, add `cards rename` now?
    - also golden-ration.md
    - also huffman-coding, not encoding
- something is wrong with pandoc html version of codeblocks
    - in mochi they look fine
- maybe add sanity check? that there are only *.md files, and no typos?
- images
    x control how large they look?
        x mochi already does it nicely
        x similar in preview mode?
    x we might already when uploading resize them to reasonable size
        x (so far it looks like the image by mochi is untouched, so it stays as large as it was)
        x we want to limit the width, not the height
x split data and code, make code public git
    x git filter-repo works
    x but check again to be sure
    x what about config.toml? deck id and stuff, should be in data instead?
    x same for credentials, but not commited
- plus the api doc is wrong, the regex cant be true, maybe talk to dev, then also ask about paging, and image changes
x we probably cannot give a better progress for list cards?
    x because we cannot parse the json before it has arrived fully?
- it's solid and easy to understand, plus with tmux project we can have some easy bin/* stuff for new or so
    - or just part of `cards add 'something'` maybe to add a template
    - that could even start vim, and then on exit run sync, or just sync that one we just edited
    - and we have some `cards ...` things to make operations, dont even need full sync all the time
o when at it, also check if single card retrieve has the attachments (as also list might not contain reviews)
x really need to separate data and code, telescope files finds too much, or control that?
- some easy parallel code could speed things up, design is very easy now
- change chrome cards shortcut to mochi when done
- eg, derivatives-fro-inverse-functions.md, wrong name
    - `cards rename` or something? since we cannot now do it just like that

notes:
- if we ever want our own ids, and mochi doesnt provide, we could use comment or invisible markdown to carry this, if it exists?
    - like the media/image names could carry a hash to detect changes and/or refer to ids
