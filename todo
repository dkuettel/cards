todo:
- in the code its not clear when paths are absolute and when not, in the context of meta.json
- something is wrong with pandoc html version of codeblocks
    - in mochi they look fine
- maybe add sanity check? that there are only *.md files, and no typos?
- plus the api doc is wrong, the regex cant be true, maybe talk to dev, then also ask about paging, and image changes
o when at it, also check if single card retrieve has the attachments (as also list might not contain reviews)
- some easy parallel code could speed things up, design is very easy now

notes:
- if we ever want our own ids, and mochi doesnt provide, we could use comment or invisible markdown to carry this, if it exists?
    - like the media/image names could carry a hash to detect changes and/or refer to ids
